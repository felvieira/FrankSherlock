# Frank Sherlock

Local-only, AI-powered image cataloging and search for your NAS. Point it at a directory, and it classifies every image using a local vision LLM, extracts text via OCR, generates thumbnails, and indexes everything into a searchable SQLite database. Nothing leaves your machine.

## What it does

- Scans image directories read-only (JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, WebP, TIFF)
- Classifies each image with Ollama's `qwen2.5vl:7b` vision model (media type, description, anime/manga identification, document detection)
- Extracts text via Surya OCR (with vision LLM fallback) for documents, receipts, screenshots
- Generates 300px JPEG thumbnails for fast browsing
- Full-text search with SQLite FTS5
- Detects renamed/moved files by fingerprint, so they don't get re-classified
- Resumes interrupted scans from the last checkpoint

## Screenshot

The UI is loosely inspired by VSCode: custom titlebar, collapsible sidebar, thumbnail grid, media type filters, confidence slider, preview overlay, and automatic light/dark theme.

## Installing from pre-built binaries

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/akitaonrails/FrankSherlock/releases): AppImage for Linux, DMG for macOS (Apple Silicon), MSI for Windows.

You also need [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running (`ollama serve`). On first launch, the app prompts you to download the vision model if it isn't installed yet.

### macOS: "app is damaged" error

The release binaries are not signed with an Apple Developer certificate. macOS Gatekeeper will quarantine the app and show a misleading "damaged and can't be opened" error. To fix this, open Terminal and run:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Frank\ Sherlock.app
```

Then open the app normally. Alternatively, right-click the `.app` and choose "Open" (instead of double-clicking) to bypass Gatekeeper on the first launch.

### Windows: SmartScreen warning

The MSI installer is not signed with a code-signing certificate. Windows SmartScreen may block it with a "Windows protected your PC" warning. Click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to proceed with installation.

## Requirements (for building from source)

- Linux, macOS, or Windows
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running (`ollama serve`)
- NVIDIA GPU recommended on Linux/Windows (RTX series works well with qwen2.5vl:7b); Apple Silicon works natively on macOS
- Node.js 20+
- Rust 1.77+

## Building from source

```bash
# 1. Download the PDFium library for your platform
cd sherlock/desktop/src-tauri
bash scripts/download-pdfium.sh

# 2. Install frontend dependencies
cd sherlock/desktop
npm install

# 3. Start Ollama (in a separate terminal)
ollama serve

# 4. Run in dev mode
npm run tauri:dev
```

To produce a release binary (AppImage/DMG/MSI):

```bash
cd sherlock/desktop
npm run tauri:build
```

Output will be in `sherlock/desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Wayland/NVIDIA workaround

If the WebKit window is blank on Wayland with NVIDIA drivers:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 GDK_BACKEND=wayland,x11 npm run tauri:dev
```

## Tests

```bash
# Rust (166 tests)
cd sherlock/desktop/src-tauri
cargo test

# Frontend (172 tests)
cd sherlock/desktop
npm run test
```

Covers classification JSON parsing, thumbnail generation, incremental scanning, database operations, scan cancellation, query parsing, platform abstraction, and UI components.

## How it works

### Incremental scanning

Built for large NAS directories with 100k+ files:

1. **Discovery** -- walks the directory tree using only filesystem metadata (mtime, size). Files matching their previous scan are marked unchanged with zero file reads.
2. **Processing** -- only new and modified files go through classification and thumbnail generation. Moved files are detected by fingerprint and just update their path reference.
3. **Cleanup** -- files no longer on disk are soft-deleted, and their cached thumbnails are removed.

Rescanning an unchanged 10k-image directory takes seconds.

### Classification pipeline

Each new image goes through several stages:

1. **Primary classification** -- 3-attempt strategy with progressive fallback prompts and regex salvage for malformed JSON
2. **Anime enrichment** -- conditional on media type; identifies series, characters, and canonical names
3. **OCR** -- Surya OCR (isolated Python venv) with vision LLM fallback; runs for documents, screenshots, and text-containing images
4. **Document extraction** -- regex + LLM extraction of dates, amounts, transaction IDs from OCR text

### Search

Full-text search across filenames, paths, descriptions, OCR text, and character/series names. Example queries:

- `anime ranma`
- `bank transfer 2024`
- `receipt santander`
- `screenshot confidence >= 0.8`

## Project structure

```
sherlock/                  <- Main application
  desktop/
    src-tauri/src/         <- Rust backend
      classify.rs          <- Ollama vision + Surya OCR pipeline
      thumbnail.rs         <- Thumbnail generation
      scan.rs              <- Incremental scanner with cancellation
      db.rs                <- SQLite + FTS5
      config.rs            <- App paths
      lib.rs               <- Tauri commands, auto-cleanup
      query_parser.rs      <- NL query parsing
      runtime.rs           <- Ollama/GPU status
      platform/            <- OS abstraction (clipboard, GPU, Python paths)
    scripts/
      surya_ocr.py         <- Isolated OCR script (bundled as Tauri resource)
    src/                   <- React frontend
      utils.ts             <- Shared utilities (basename, errorMessage)
      __tests__/fixtures.ts <- Shared test mock objects
_classification/           <- Python PoC of the classification pipeline
```

### Research and prototyping (historical)

These directories contain the A/B testing research that informed model selection and pipeline design. They aren't part of the main application.

```
_research_ab_test/
  scripts/                 <- A/B benchmark scripts
  docs/                    <- Research notes (IDEA.md, RESULTS.md, etc.)
  lib/                     <- Shared Python helpers
  results/                 <- Generated benchmark outputs (gitignored)
  test_files/              <- Test corpus (gitignored, see note below)
```

> **Note:** The test files (images, audio, video, documents) used for benchmarking are not included. They contained copyrighted media and personal documents. To re-run the benchmarks:
>
> 1. Add your own media files in `_research_ab_test/test_files/` with subdirectories like `images/`, `old_audio/`, `old_docs/`, `old_tvseries/`
> 2. Update the ground truth JSON files in `_research_ab_test/docs/` to match your corpus
> 3. Adjust the benchmark scripts as needed

The benchmark results (`_research_ab_test/docs/RESULTS.md`) show why `qwen2.5vl:7b` was chosen over `llava:13b` and `minicpm-v:8b` (80% type accuracy vs 33-50%), and why Surya was picked as primary OCR (95% reference similarity, better coverage than vision LLM alone).

## Data storage

All application data lives under `~/.local/share/frank_sherlock/`:

```
db/index.sqlite            <- SQLite database with FTS5
cache/thumbnails/          <- Generated thumbnails (mirrored path structure)
cache/classifications/     <- Classification cache
cache/tmp/                 <- Temporary files (GIF frames, etc.)
surya_venv/                <- Isolated Python venv for Surya OCR
```

Source directories are never modified. Frank Sherlock is strictly read-only.

## CI

GitHub Actions runs on every push and PR against main:

- Platforms: Ubuntu 22.04, macOS (latest), Windows (latest)
- Checks: `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt --check`, `npm run build`, `npm run test`, `cargo audit` (Linux only)

Releases are built on `v*` tags for Linux (AppImage), macOS (Apple Silicon DMG), and Windows (MSI).
